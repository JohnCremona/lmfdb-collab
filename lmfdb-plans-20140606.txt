Notes from LMFDB planning session at the Warwick workshop, 6 June 2014
(copied from the blackboard after discussion led by David Farmer and
John Cremona):

* Small group meeting to improve the code / testing / standards /
  data-mirroring, with follow-up

* Recruit more Haralds

* Better

  - documentation

  - communication

  - issue tracking

  - code review

  - records of activity and decisions via the github repositories
    which exist (as well as lmfdb/lmfdb there are lmfdb/lmfdb-data and
    lmfdb/lmfdb-collab, each with issue tracking and wiki pages)

* Seek funding for

  - paying technical people

  - more workshops

* Encourage research papers relating to LMFDB work

  - topic for a dedicated workshop?

  - announce planned papers to the group

  - write a paper on the LMFDB project itself (for ANTS 2016?)

  - give better credit for research which goes into the LMFDB and
    elsewhere (e.g. details of algorithms or results stimulated by the
    LMFDB)

* Workshop and small group meetings.  Proposals are encouraged for
  small focussed working groups to meet (away from usual
  distractions), perhaps right before a workshop so that feedback on
  new work can be obtained quickly.  Suggested topics for larger
  workshops are also welcome.  In 2015 there will be a workshop in the
  first half, perhaps in April, perhaps at AIM.  During September -
  December there will be many LMFDB-related activities at the ICERM
  semester including the three workshops there.

  - writing LMFDB-related research papers

  - algebraic modular forms (on compact groups)

  - Hecke characters (small group - Andy Booker)

  - genus 2 curves and abelian surfaces (small group - Haluk Sengun)

  - weight 1 modular forms (small group)

  - subgroups of SL(2,Z), Belyi maps and modular curves -- bring in
    new people (Pauli, Cunningham)

  - Galois representations (a topic for Trieste, September 2014)

  - Groups as a main heading in the LMFDB menu, including
    algebraicgroups -- but do not try to be too ambitions and include
    everything!

  - Second level main pages for topics to include

    # data referenced in a paper

    # permanent URL

    # low threshold for adding new data

* Add your name to the contributors list (edit the CONTRUBUTORS.yaml
  file and issue a pull request).

* Cite the LMFDB and acknowledge support (funding) through workshop
  attendance and use of machines bought with grants, for use in
  regular reports to current funding agency and in future funding
  applications.  John Cremona to send a link to the Google form set up
  by Mike Rubinstein to make collection of data on preprints and
  papers very easy.
